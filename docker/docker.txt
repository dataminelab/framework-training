To access docker on OsX, see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39540471/cant-access-docker-container-on-port-80-on-osx

Accessing via localhost doesn't work, instead check the IP address:

# docker-machine ip default


Example:

Tensor-flow docker:
https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_mac

docker run -it -p 8888:8888 gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow

then follow up the instructions, for example this is mine URL to access the Jupyter notebook:
http://192.168.99.100:8888/tree
